# psp2etoi
Unique Device Identifiers manager for PlayStation Vita/TV<br>
<br>
This tool allows you to backup or edit the Unique Device Identifiers - ConsoleID and OpenPSID.<br>
The utility is also capable of dumping or flashing the [syscon S/NVS](https://wiki.henkaku.xyz/vita/Ernie#NVS) that contains configuration data such as QA flags, management flags, boot flags and much more.<br>
<br>

## Usage
Please keep in mind that this tool is intended for advanced users only; a wrong configuration or program bug can lead to unrecoverable system corruption requiring a motherboard replacement.

### Prerequisites
#### Recommended:
 - The target Playstation Vita/TV console should be running release firmware version 3.65 of type CEX/DEX/TOOL/CFT
 - As a form of recovery the console should have enso_ex v5.0 installed and running
#### Required:
 - The target Playstation Vita/TV console must be running firmware version between (including) 3.60 and 3.74
 - The console must have the taihenkaku CFW framework installed and running
 - The psp2etoi.vpk app package should be installed via VitaShell

### Creating a backup
 - Open the 'psp2etoi' app. After accepting the disclaimer it will perform a selftest
 - Select "Backup the current Unique...". It will create a backup of encrypted ConsoleID and OpenPSID
 - Select "Dump the current device...". It will create a backup of the current device configuration and S/NVS
 - Copy out the backup files from `ux0:data/psp2etoi/`. Store them in multiple copies on separate storages
   - `udi.bin` is the ConsoleID and OpenPSID in an encrypted format that can be directly written to idstorage
   - `output.cfg` is a psp2etoi configuration file containing all data that psp2etoi can modify
   - `nvs.bin` is a dump of the console's S/NVS

### Writing a custom configuration
  - refer to [the configuration manual](CONFIGURATION.md)

### Creating a custom configuration via psp2etoi
  - Clean the `ux0:data/psp2etoi/` directory
  - Place a configuration file as `ux0:data/psp2etoi/input.req`
    - this configuration will serve as a 'template' for the custom configuration
    - the configuration must have the `INPUT` tag set to `false`
  - Open the 'psp2etoi' app. After accepting the disclaimer it will perform a selftest
  - Select "Create a custom...". It will parse the template and generate a matching configuration
  - The custom configuration can be found in `ux0:data/psp2etoi/custom_input.cfg`

### Installing a psp2etoi configuration
 - Clean the `ux0:data/psp2etoi/` directory
 - Place the input configuration file as `ux0:data/psp2etoi/input.cfg`
   - if the configuration requires supplementary files put them there too
   - the input configuration must have the `INPUT` tag set to `true`
 - Open the 'psp2etoi' app. After accepting the disclaimer it will perform a selftest
 - Select "Apply a custom...". It will parse the configuration file and show expected changes
 - After confirming that the changes are correct press triangle to write the new configuration
   - a backup configuration file based on the input configuration will be written to `backup_input.cfg`
 - You should copy out the `backup_` files and store them in multiple copies on separate storages
   - They can be used to revert changes made by the `input.cfg`
<br>

## Notes
 - It is extremely easy to permanently "brick" your console using this tool
   - a simple mistake such as wrong byte or space in the wrong place can result in a "brick"
 - You should only use this tool having understood how writing the desired configuration data impacts the device
 - You should always double-check the input configuration file as well as the app's parser output before applying
 - Bad ConsoleID type/sub-code should be recoverable with enso_ex v5, provided you have the backed-up `udi.bin`
